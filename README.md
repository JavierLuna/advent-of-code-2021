# Advent of code 2020

Here's my 2021 attempt at AOC. I will try to do this daily but I will not sweat it if I cannot do it one day.

I will be trying to learn Rust along the way. Because the leadership board's pressure is real, maybe I'll do solutions
first in python and then in rust.

## The AOC Framework

No framework this year lol.
